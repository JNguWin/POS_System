        UPDATES
        1) This project was difficult at first because javascript was a new concept
            so learning how to create buttons and text fields was the first obstacle.
        2) Setting the names and values and knowing the differences and what they do
            took me a bit of time to understand
        3) I learned how to use the id in javascript to get value from the html doc
        4) Creating the drop down list for drink and size was one of my first obstacles,
            by using select and option I was able to create a drop down and assign values
        5) Using labels and inputs I was able to create text fields for customer inputs
        6) Similar to C# I created a click event that starts the whole process
        7) Within that click event I set my variables using "let" and "document.getElementById"
        8) Using those values I was able to create a layout of information for an order 
            in the display box
        9) I ran into trouble displaying the selected option in drop down list and text fields
        10) I was able to overcome this by adding ".value" at the end of the variable name
        11) Clearing the display box after every click and incrementing the customer number
            is the last thing I need to do to finish my project
        12) Will was able to help me clear display and show incrementing
